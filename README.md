This repository contains code for simple neural network implementation without using sklearn's Neural Network library. 
To run the Neural Network code, these are the steps need to be followed - 

The code has the following dependencies, which need to be installed before running this code:
a) Python. Install version greater than 3.5
b) Pandas. More details at: https://pandas.pydata.org/
c) Scikit Learn Library to train and test data split
d) Download the dataset in the dataset folder by given link in the NeuralNet.py code file.
# DataSet Downloaded from UCI Machine Learning dataset repository
# Download dataset from the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer/
e) Run the driver.py file for the results.
